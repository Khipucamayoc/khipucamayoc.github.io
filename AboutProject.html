          <p class="text-white-50"> 
          I would have liked to start this text by sharing my memories about the moment in which the fascination for Quipus began for me: it would have been the ideal way to start writing this text, but this will not be possible for me, for the simple reason that I can no longer remember it. For me, as for a large part of the ex school students in Peru, the quipus are a key piece of that "ancestral heritage" that we are taught since elementary school, next to the "Coast, Andes and Amazonia" that attempts cohesion in between the different regions and their peoples for a children's mind that sees the need to flatten the authentically labyrinthine and cracked history of my country, when it is explained in a didactic way together with the Incas, the Wari, and the Lord of Sipán: all the complex and largely still unintelligible cultures of our ancestors that are presented to us since school times as what constitutes our National Identity. And it is that, as Peruvians, sometimes it seems that we are only the preserved remains of that legendary past: that is the image that with effort we (re) build and export to an exterior where we are rarely seen as innovators, discoverers, or inventors, and, if so, then usually falling within a framework that could be considered exotic when that cultural legacy - that of before but not now - is commonly referenced.

          
          </p><p class="text-white-50">Frank Salomon, an important American anthropologist, tells how one of his most important collaborators in his research work in the town of San Andrés de Tupicocha was, in fact, a child: Nery Rojas, then of school age, took the knowledge that he shared his grandfather, perhaps the last Quipucamayoc, strengthening them with what he was taught in school about the theories related to the orders and magnitudes that the knots embedded in the strings of the quipus (indicated through their position and number of turns) that part of a system developed by the anthropologist couple Robert and Marcia Ascher (initially proposed by Leland Locke) and which is the most robust decoding method to date. Contrary to what is affirmed somewhat mediatically, there is still no certainty that the Quipus have contained something similar to text or even words, at least not as we conceive them: mostly used for the management of taxes and accounting In general, nowadays it is relatively easy to understand how the vast majority of specimens found store numerical data, that is, depending on the position and the turns that each knot has (each turn representing a unit), in such a way that the most knots close to the main string (from where they hang) are those that represent the highest magnitudes (tens, hundreds, etc.), and those knots that approach the end of the pendants, since they define the units of the amount represented (although there is a type of knot that is understood as the unit "one", which follows the format of a double knot or "eight"). 

          </p><p class="text-white-50">  It is speculated that the colors of the strings, and some markers that were placed on them, also served to provide information about clans (ayllus) and other population classifications. However, there are a few quipus found that, despite following the Inca structure, do not follow the model of number of turns or knot position that we spoke about earlier: these are the ones that have given rise to the interest of discovering and verifying the hypothesis that, in fact, these Quipus contained a type of writing system. This captivating thesis has attracted various researchers, mostly from large American and European Universities, who, a bit in the style of Indiana Jones as well, have visited many Andean peoples seeking access to specimens, extracting the data that ideally support that ambitious theory. which, if not true, could make the once development and management of an Empire as complex and vast as that of the Incas become incomprehensible (or impossible). With this I do not want to deny the relevance of this search: my intention is finally to highlight a dynamic that often leaves people and their stories aside or that can end up interpreting them to the liking of the investigator on call. It is also worth noting that this classification, the finally subjective differentiation between the historical and the prehistoric through the marker of what is written (or not), would be what keeps the pre-Columbian South American peoples mired in a tacit prehistory that only seems to end with the arrival of the Spanish and their Bibles containing the annotated word.  
          <h2 class="text-white mb-4">Of Quipus and Graves</h2>
          </p><p class="text-white-50"> Today these textile accounting tools are referred to as the technology of the past, appearing even in the list of the "Dead Media Archives" of New York University along with the abacus, the jacquard loom, and text-based computer games. Along these lines, we are often told that they are objects found in burials, that they were used by communities that had already disappeared, and that they followed a single format: that of a main rope, from which the data that kept the data hung. The truth is that an example of this textile tool has been found even in the citadel of Caral (considered the oldest in America), although the renowned Gary Urton questioned, at the time, the antiquity that the Peruvian archaeologist Ruth Shady proposed for the specimen found in the place (2500 years). Beyond specifics, the Caral quipu gives us an idea, albeit uncertain, of how long and complex the history of the quipus is. It is worth clarifying that even the Wari used them, although in a different format than the Inca - in fact, the system of knots in strings as a method of notation seems to have been developed by many cultures worldwide, although the basic structure of the quipus would be unique.

           <h2 class="text-white mb-4">The Neo-Quipucamayocs</h2>
            <p class="text-white-50"> 
         
        
In Quechua, knot is called "khipu", and those experts who knew how to handle the system were known as khipucamayocs (which means something like knot specialist). They were the ones in charge of coding statistical data regarding the populations and their tributes, compiling information involving the various human groups, their composition and quantity of agricultural production. It makes sense then to see the Quipus Tupicochanos exposed in the civic festival of Huayrona: it is then that the representatives of the community, (mayor, councilmen, etc.) report on their achievements, their deficiencies, their breaches and their mistakes. This is also the moment when the new communal representatives are selected, the Quipu being what is symbolically placed on the body of the elected; Quipu is, therefore, a living culture in the Andean area, still part of a current tradition (not redesigned to be seen by tourists, although it has begun to become popular beyond its borders) despite the fact that its use no longer has to do directly with data storage.  </p><p class="text-white-50">Jorge Eduardo Eielson, 1987-8
</p><p class="text-white-50">
At this point it is worth clarifying that the Quipu tradition not only survived in the hands of these peoples since since the beginning of the twentieth century as they have been referenced in a diverse but stable way in the modern arts, although in a somewhat dispersed way: very well known is Cecilia Vicuña, who has worked extensively on the subject since the seventies, drawing inspiration from the aesthetic, symbolic and historical qualities of quipus to perform from actions to performances and large textile installations, going through themes that have to do with feminism, the Andean worldview, word/poetics and memory. I think it is not necessary to delve into her work since she is quite well known: she would be the artist who has achieved the greatest recognition with the subject, and she is the one who finally popularized this reference in contemporary art. However, she is neither the only one nor the first to work on it: I will call this early current of artists the Neo-Quipucamayocs, since they are the first to function as modern quipucamayocs by taking the performance of quipus as an artistic practice in itself. Yes, for various reasons and in a somewhat isolated way: we can speak of the beginning of a movement, which unfortunately does not finish defining itself as such precisely because of the dispersion of its representatives, who never sat down to talk and exchange ideas. </p><p class="text-white-50">
   <h2 class="text-white mb-4">Contemporary Khipumancy</h2>              
</p><p class="text-white-50">
There are several artists who are now radically taking the reference of original art as emulating the indigenistas of the early twentieth century in their interest in seeing beyond Western art, with the difference that what was then treated as part of the past (if it subsisted culturally, it did so as a remnant) is now presented as a possible and even necessary future for these times of socio-climatic crisis. The latter also reminds us of the European avant-garde of the s. XX, although then idealizing the human-machine symbiosis (still understood as machinery), since technology would now be presented as a kind of interface between the earth / natural world, and the human while considering the expansion of the concept of the techne itself. The latter could be one of the characteristics of the phenomenon in contemporary arts that I will now proceed to define as the continuation of the Knot of Code project, and it is already clearly found in some recent publications, such as Alan Poma's "Andean Futurist Manifesto", a text in which he imagines a link between Russian Futurism at the beginning of the last century, and the amalgam of cosmovisions and aesthetics that we understand as "Andean Culture" or the “Andean Information Age” of Oscar Santillan, in both cases, referrin more to a pre-Columbian reading from a fundamentally visual perspective, of evidently archaeological inspiration  The text is relevant insofar it appropriates a term that has become popular in non-Western contexts (intentionally following the line of Afrofuturism or Techno-Orientalism) thus giving back a bit of symbolic agency to the groups it would come to represent, while It also brings to mind the once influence of Andean design (also of an archaeological nature and valued through objects displayed in Museums, in private collections, or as exotic ornaments imported from distant lands) which served as a little-recognized inspiration to various avant-garde and European formalisms.
